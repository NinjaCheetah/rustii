# rustii
*Like rusty but it's rustii because the Wii? Get it?*

A very WIP and experimental port of [libWiiPy](https://github.com/NinjaCheetah/libWiiPy) to Rust.

### What's Included
- Structs for TMDs and Tickets that can be created from binary data
- Simple Title Key encryption/decryption
- Content encryption/decryption
- WAD parsing (allowing for packing/unpacking)
- A very basic test binary that makes sure these things work as expected

### What's Not Included
- Basically anything else. This library doesn't do a whole lot yet, and the included `rustii` binary isn't even remotely similar to WiiPy yet. Eventually it aims to be a more optimized replacement for it.


Please note that my Rust code isn't great, I'm still very new to it.
